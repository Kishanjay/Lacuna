# Statistics retrieval
This folder contains scripts that can be utilized to retrieve information about web applications modified by different analysis tools.



## Process
The process contains several steps, which must be ran *in order*, without duplicates.
Several steps modify the application irreversably, so *make a backup* before you start.


### 0. Install required packages
Run `npm install` in the following folders:

+ `add_logs/`
+ `get_all/`


### 1. Setup
First, create a _processed_ folder.
Then, for each application, create a folder in the _processed_ folder (e.g. _processed/my-app/_)
In this folder, add the different versions, modified by analyzers (i.e. _dynamic_, _static_nativecalls_, _original_ and _dynamic_static_nativecalls_).


### 2. Modify scripts
Edit `list.txt`, each line should contain the folder name (app name) you wish to retrieve statistics for.


### 3. Run base scripts
Run
```
node ./add_logs.js
node ./get_all.js
```
This creates the file _all.txt_ in each application folder.


### 4. Test applications by hand
Now, open and test functionality with each application type. After you have done so, open the console, and enter
```
var w=window.open('');w.document.write("<pre>" + ___jdce_logger_safe.join('\n') + "<pre>");
```
This should open a new window with a list of function calls. Copy output from new screen to a file with the name of the analyzer type (e.g. for _dynamic_, the file is _processed/my-app/dynamic.txt_).
This name should correspond to the folder name of the app analysis version you just tested.



### 5. Retrieve statistics
Run
```
node remove_duplicates.js
node statistics.js <type>
```
Where _<type>_ is _static_, _dynamic_ or _hybrid_.

This should output a LaTeX table (for analysis type _<type>_) for each entry in the `list.txt` file.

You can also run
```
node averages.js <type>
```
for the average and median recall and precision.
